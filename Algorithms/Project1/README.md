In Scala 3.5.0 (and some newer versions), the command `scala run MainApp.scala` may not behave as expected due to changes in how the Scala compiler and runtime handle command-line arguments and file execution.

Here’s how you can handle this properly, especially when dealing with multiple `.scala` files in a project, by using **sbt**.

### Steps to Run the Project Using sbt

1. **Create an sbt Project**:
   Set up your project with the proper directory structure for **sbt**. Here's the typical structure:

   ```
   my-project/
   ├── build.sbt
   ├── project/
   ├── src/
   │   ├── main/
   │   │   └── scala/
   │   │       ├── Euclid.scala
   │   │       ├── Fibonacci.scala
   │   │       ├── Factorial.scala
   │   │       └── MainApp.scala
   └── target/
   ```

2. **Create `build.sbt` File**:
   In the root directory of your project, create a `build.sbt` file with the following content:

   ```sbt
   name := "ScalaToDoApp"

   version := "0.1"

   scalaVersion := "3.5.0" // or any other version you are using

   // You can add more dependencies or settings here if needed
   ```

3. **Add Your Scala Files**:
   Place your Scala files (`Euclid.scala`, `Fibonacci.scala`, `Factorial.scala`, and `MainApp.scala`) in the `src/main/scala/` directory.

4. **Compile and Run Using sbt**:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory (`my-project/`).
   - Start sbt by typing:
   
     ```bash
     sbt
     ```

   - Once sbt is started, compile your project by typing:
   
     ```bash
     compile
     ```

   - After compilation, run your application by typing:
   
     ```bash
     run
     ```

### Why `scala run MainApp.scala` Fails

When you use `scala run MainApp.scala`, the following issues may occur:

1. **Main Class Not Detected**: If you are trying to run a file with multiple `.scala` files (especially if your classes are spread across different files), the Scala CLI may not be able to detect the correct main class without a proper build configuration like sbt provides.
   
2. **Recompilation on Each Run**: When you use `scala MainApp.scala`, it tries to compile and run the file directly, but it won't link it with the other files in your project automatically. Additionally, it will recompile the files every time you run the command, which is inefficient for larger projects.

### Summary

To avoid issues when working with multiple files in a project and to manage dependencies more efficiently, it is recommended to use **sbt**. It handles compilation, linking, and execution smoothly for both small and large projects, and it offers more control over how you build and run Scala applications.
